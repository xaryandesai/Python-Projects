## Python Projects 🐍

I made several different programs when I was learning Python. These included:

- **2048 Tile game** - This is a popular puzzle game where you slide tiles on a grid to combine them into larger numbers.
   
- **Currency converter** - This program allows you to convert money from one currency to another.
   
- **LeapYear detector** - This checks if a given year is a leap year or not.
   
- **Password generator** - This creates random, strong passwords for better security.
   
- **Phone number lookup** - This shows information like location and provider for a given phone number.
    
- **Text-to-Speech app** - This reads out loud any text that you input.
  
- **YouTube Video downloader** - This lets you download videos from YouTube to watch offline.

For all these programs, I used the Tkinter library in Python to build the graphical user interface (GUI) that lets users interact with the programs. Using Tkinter allowed me to create windows, buttons, menus and other visual elements to make the programs user-friendly.
